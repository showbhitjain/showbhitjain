## 🧠 About Me

I'm a robotics engineer passionate about developing real-time control systems for robotic manipulators. My focus lies in motion planning, model-based control architectures, optimization-based inverse kinematics and robotic manipulation. I specialize in building reliable and testable robotic software in C++, with integrated tooling for simulation and visualization.

## 📌 Featured Project

### 🦾 Obstacle Avoidance for Serial-Chain Manipulators  
📁 [Repository Link](https://github.com/showbhitjain/TUM_SJ_ObstacleAvoidanceLib)

This project was developed as part of my Master’s thesis and implements static, dynamic, and self-collision avoidance for the Franka Emika Panda robot using a modular, real-time capable C++ framework.

**✅ Publicly Testable (Offline):**
- Static obstacle avoidance  
- Self-collision avoidance  
- MATLAB and Python-based 3D trajectory visualization tools  

**⚠️ Restricted:**
Real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance code depends on private repositories (vision modules) and is not executable outside the original development environment. However, experiment results and videos are publicly available.
