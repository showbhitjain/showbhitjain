# 👋 Hi, I'm Shobhit Jain

Robotics Engineer (M.Sc. Mechatronics & Robotics, TUM) passionate about real-time control, motion planning, and intelligent manipulation.  
I build efficient and testable robotic software in **C++** and **Python**, integrating simulation, visualization, and optimization tools.

## 📌 Featured Project

### 🦾 Obstacle Avoidance for Serial-Chain Manipulators  
📁 [Repository Link](https://github.com/showbhitjain/TUM_SJ_ObstacleAvoidanceLib)

This project was developed as part of my Master’s thesis and implements static, dynamic, and self-collision avoidance for serial chain manipulators with revolute joints using a  C++ framework. The repository README includes links to the full thesis, presentation slides, technical brief, and experimental videos demonstrating the results.


**✅ Publicly Testable (Offline):**
- Static obstacle avoidance  
- Self-collision avoidance  
- MATLAB and Python-based 3D trajectory visualization tools  

**⚠️ Restricted:**
Real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance code depends on private repositories (vision modules) and is not executable outside the original development environment. However, experiment results and videos are publicly available.
