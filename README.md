# 👋 Hi, I'm Shobhit Jain

Robotics Engineer (M.Sc. Mechatronics & Robotics, TUM) passionate about real-time control, motion planning, and intelligent manipulation.  
I build efficient and testable robotic software in **C++** and **Python**, integrating simulation, visualization, and optimization tools.

## 📌 Featured Project

### 🦾 Obstacle Avoidance for Serial-Chain Manipulators  
📁 [Repository Link](https://github.com/showbhitjain/TUM_SJ_ObstacleAvoidanceLib)

This project was developed as part of my Master’s thesis and implements static, dynamic, and self-collision avoidance for serial chain manipulators with revolute joints using a  C++ framework. The repository README includes links to the full thesis, presentation slides, technical brief, and experimental videos demonstrating the results.


**✅ Publicly Testable (Offline):**
- Static obstacle avoidance  
- Self-collision avoidance  
- MATLAB and Python-based 3D trajectory visualization tools  

**⚠️ Restricted:**
Real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance code depends on private repositories (vision modules) and is not executable outside the original development environment. However, experiment results and videos are publicly available.

## 🚀 Learning & Development Roadmap
ROS 2 Learning Practice
Hands-on implementations from the ROS 2 for Beginners (Parts 1–3) and ROS2_Control courses (Packt/Udemy).
Built and tested in C++ and Python, this repository consolidates almost all ROS 2 concepts — nodes, services, actions, TF2, URDF/Xacro, and controller frameworks — forming the foundation for advanced robot manipulation.  
Skills Strengthened: ROS 2 Jazzy • ros2_control • TF2 • Gazebo • URDF/Xacro • Component Nodes • C++17 • Python • Multithreaded Executors
Next:
- MoveIt 2 for Manipulation and Perception (Pick-and-Place Project)

- Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera) — PyTorch + YOLO + OpenCV for vision-based grasping

##🦾 Upcoming: Pick-and-Place Manipulation Project

📆 Planned: November 2025

A complete ROS 2 (Jazzy)–based manipulation pipeline integrating ros2_control, MoveIt 2, and a perception module using OpenCV and YOLOv8 for 6-DoF grasp estimation.
The project will focus on trajectory planning, motion execution, and sensor-driven grasping using simulated RGB-D data in Gazebo/Isaac Sim.
