# 👋 Hi, I'm Shobhit Jain

Robotics Engineer (M.Sc. Mechatronics & Robotics, TUM) passionate about real-time control, motion planning, and intelligent manipulation.  
I build efficient and testable robotic software in **C++** and **Python**, integrating simulation, visualization, and optimization tools.

## 📌 Featured Project

### 🦾 Obstacle Avoidance for Serial-Chain Manipulators  
📁 [Repository Link](https://github.com/showbhitjain/TUM_SJ_ObstacleAvoidanceLib)

This project was developed as part of my Master’s thesis and implements static, dynamic, and self-collision avoidance for serial chain manipulators with revolute joints using a  C++ framework. The repository README includes links to the full thesis, presentation slides, technical brief, and experimental videos demonstrating the results.


**✅ Publicly Testable (Offline):**
- Static obstacle avoidance  
- Self-collision avoidance  
- MATLAB and Python-based 3D trajectory visualization tools  

**⚠️ Restricted:**
Real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance code depends on private repositories (vision modules) and is not executable outside the original development environment. However, experiment results and videos are publicly available.

## 🚀 Learning & Development Roadmap

📁 [Repository Link](Soon)


Hands-on implementations from the **ROS 2 for Beginners (Parts 1–3)** and **ros2_Control** courses (Packt/Udemy).  
Developed in **C++** and **Python**, this repository consolidates key ROS 2 concepts forming a strong foundation for advanced robotic manipulation and perception projects.

**Skills Strengthened:**  
ROS 2 Jazzy • ros2_control • TF2 • Gazebo • URDF/Xacro • Multithreaded Executors • C++17 • Python  

**Next Steps:**  
- MoveIt 2 for Manipulation and Perception (Pick-and-Place Project)  
- Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera) — PyTorch + YOLO + OpenCV for vision-based grasping  

---

### 🦾 Upcoming: Pick-and-Place Manipulation Project  
📆 **Planned:** November 2025  

A complete **ROS 2 (Jazzy)**–based manipulation pipeline integrating **ros2_control**, **MoveIt 2**, and a **perception module** using **OpenCV** and **YOLOv8** for 6-DoF grasp estimation.  
This project will focus on **trajectory planning**, **motion execution**, and **sensor-driven grasping** using simulated RGB-D data in **Gazebo/Isaac Sim**.

**Goals:**  
- Implement motion planning and control for a robotic arm  
- Integrate object detection and pose estimation with MoveIt 2  
- Demonstrate a full perception → planning → control pipeline
